# HTML Basics

## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design documents on the web. It structures web pages and their content using a series of elements and tags.

## How to Create an HTML Page from a Wireframe

Creating an HTML page from a wireframe involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Sections and Components**: Break down the wireframe into sections like header, footer, sidebar, and main content area.
2. **Map Components to HTML Tags**: Determine which HTML tags best represent each component.
3. **Write HTML Code**: Write the HTML code to replicate the wireframe's layout.

### Example:

Wireframe: A basic web page with a header, main content, and footer.

HTML Code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This is the main content area.</p>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>Footer Information</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

## What is a Markup Language?

A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. HTML is a type of markup language used to define the structure and presentation of web content.

## What is the DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page as a tree of objects that can be manipulated with programming languages like JavaScript.

## What is an Element/Tag?

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. For example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
A tag is the markup that defines an element, such as `<p>` for a paragraph.

## What is an Attribute?

An attribute provides additional information about an HTML element, specified in the opening tag. Attributes come in name/value pairs like `name="value"`. For example:
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
```
The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the link.

## Purpose of Common HTML Tags

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` the lowest.
- `<p>`: Paragraphs of text.
- `<a>`: Hyperlinks to other web pages or resources.
- `<img>`: Images.
- `<div>`: Division or container for other elements.
- `<span>`: Inline container for text or other elements.
